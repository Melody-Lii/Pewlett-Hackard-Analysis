# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

    In this Challenge, it shows how many roles need to begin to make an impact and identify retirement-ready employees who qualify to mentor the next generation.
    
    First of all, create tables for departments, employees, dept_manager, titles, dept_emp and salaries using Jupyter notebook. Then create new tables for retirment eligibility and the number of employees retiring with hire-date between 1985-01-01 to 1988-12-31 and born between 1952-01-01 to 1955-12-31. 
    
    At the end, by using SELECT to create new tables for [titles] retiring, and partitiont the date to show only most recent per employee, then counting the number of employee per title, and finally create a list of employees eligible for potential entorship program. So there are 2382 people are eligible.
